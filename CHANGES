- $Sub::Autostub::return_values to handle 
  user-supplied returns for specific sub names.

- $Sub::Autostub::verbose to set verbosity.

- Verbose changed to 0..3 with 0 being slient,
  1 (default) listing called sub only, 2 adding
  caller, 3 adding caller + args.

- Updated tests to include return values and
  verbose.

- Interface won't change at this point and the 
  AUTOLOAD's seem to work so I'm upping the 
  version to 1.00.
